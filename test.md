This spreadsheet was created to track equity payouts for my small business. It demonstrates the use of relational formulas, and conditional formatting in a clean and reproducible structure on a project by project basis for business tracking and efficiency.

The "TEMPLATE" sheet can be duplicated by project and used to calculate equity payouts, taxes, tip percentages and more rapidly.

The "SUMMARY" sheet tracks income, equity splits and subcontracted payments in a visually appealing format.

When total income is inputted into a project sheet, labour splits are auto populated based on assigned percentages, as demonstrated in "labour_split.png"

To transfer project information to the "SUMMARY" sheet, the project sheet names simply must be entered into column A, and the sheet will reference based on sheet title to auto populate the equity division information, as demonstrated in "summary_input.png"
